## Hi, I'm Emilia ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer, with **Python** being my primary area of professional development. I particularly enjoy working with **Django**, as it allows me to create dynamic and functional web applications. [Here](https://github.com/ehaligow/cookingDjangoApp)  I am developing a simple Django project that helps me further improve my skills. [This repo](https://github.com/ehaligow/cookingApp/tree/main) includes an integration with **Vue.js** as I explore connecting the frontend with the backend. 

I also have experience working with **Docker**, especially in the context of microservices, which has enhanced my ability to manage distributed systems efficiently

Additionally, I have a solid background in utilizing **relational databases (SQL)** for effective data management, and have used testing frameworks (**unittest**) to ensure high-quality code.

Additionally, in my work, I have used testing frameworks (**unittest**) to test applications, ensuring high-quality code.
